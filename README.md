# React-Weather-app

This app was developed using React.js and React Router. 
The weather data is recived from openweathermap API. 
One part of the application displays data in a chart which is achieved with Chart.js library.

The user can get weather info for current location, and, if the user denies request for location, he/she can search for any city and get weather information for searched city. There is also 'Serbian weather' tab which lists weather info for five Serbian cities.

The user can also click on the name of a city and get detailed forecast for five days and recieve a chart that shows detailed weather info for every 3 hours.
